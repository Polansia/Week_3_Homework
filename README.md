# Week_3_Homework

In this homework I took what I learned in javascript and in utilizing web API to create a functioning passwork generator. 
I used logic to incorporate a sucessful filter system for what the user wants and minimum requirements they must fulfil.
I also used bootstrap and javascript to create a functioning button that sucessfully calls the function to generate a password.
I also organized the directory and code to be straighforward and easily understandable.
